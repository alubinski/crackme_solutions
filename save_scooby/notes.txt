Save Scooby
Goals: Write a keygen
Constrains: No decompiling and no patching

1. Use file $1 - learned architecture and program is not stripped, so we can look at assembles (symbols)
2. Use nm $1 - we learn about outside symbols - getcwd, strlen
3. Use strings $1 - learned about displayable strings in std::out, found prompts and success/failed message
	Success: You won a medal Scooby !!
	Failed: Scooby Doobie Doo!! Not too easy
4. Try easiest solution - write cwd - expected fail
5. Open File in ADA and translate to psuodo C - code and explanation in file pseudo.c
6. write script to encrypt cwd and create keygen.
